<!-- THE TITLE FOR THIS PAGE is in the <doctitle> element of the "javadoc" task in robolectric/build.xml (where I would never have thought to look for it...) -->

This document describes the elements of the Robolectric API, such as Shadow classes, Annotations, and TestRunners, that
a developer is likely to use or extend. While the goal of Robolectric is to provide a complete solution for test
driving Android applications, it is important to also acknowledge that every project is different and the needs of
different applications may place conflicting demands upon the tools that support them. For this reason the components
that make up Robolectric have been designed to be extended or replaced as needed. <p>

If you have created extensions to Robolectric that you believe to be of use to a larger audience, please consider
forking the main Robolectric repository at http://github.com/pivotal/robolectric and submitting your changes as pull
requests.
