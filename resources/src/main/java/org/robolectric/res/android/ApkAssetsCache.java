/**
 * A global cache for ApkAssets (framework and app resources). This cache is shared between
 * sandboxes to avoid having to store multiple copies of system resources for the same SDK level
 * (i.e. different looper, graphics modes, or instrumentation configuration).
 *
 * <p>Previously there was a per-sandbox cache for system resources, but with the resource tables
 * growing in size, and an increasing number of sandbox parameters, the memory usage did not scale
 * well as test suites increased in size.
 *
 * <p>Currently the items in this cache are not made available for GC. However, it would definitely
 * be possible to have a per-sdk-level reference counting mechanism where an item could be freed if
 * all sandboxes referencing that item are collected.
