/**
 * A {@link org.robolectric.pluginapi.config.Configurer} annotation for controlling how
 * Robolectric performs UI layout.
 *
 * PR #4818 changed Robolectric to be more realistic when performing layout on Android views.
 * This change in behavior could cause tests still using the legacy 'UNPAUSED' looper mode or
 * relying on views being a specific size to fail.
 *
 * This annotation can be applied to tests to have Robolectric perform the legacy, less accurate
 * mechanism of laying out and measuring Android text views, as a stopgap until the tests can be
 * properly fixed.
 *
 * This annotation will be deleted in a forthcoming Robolectric release.
